<h1> If you want to launch the game without python, use "shmup_installer.exe"</h1>

**pygame needed!**
**LAUNCH = alien_invasion.py**

gameplay options:

**Arrow keys - Movement**

**<kbd>A</kbd> - Fire**

Game gets slightly harder every 20 seconds, with increased kill score each level


The point of the game is simple: shoot aliens, score high, don't get hit.

Hold A and turn these poorly designed aliens to mush!!
There are powerups that can upgrade your arsenal.

You get three lives, once you lose them all, game ends.
