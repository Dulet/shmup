**pygame needed!**
**LAUNCH = alien_invasion.py**

gameplay options:

**Arrow keys - Movement**

**<kbd>A</kbd> - Fire**

Game gets slightly harder every 30 seconds, with increased kill score each level


The point of the game is simple: shoot aliens, score high, don't get hit.

At the beginning you get 3 ammo, means you can have three bullets on the screen at the same time. There are powerups that can upgrade your arsenal, such as:

**B** - gives you extra bullet

**Thunder** - giving you extra bullet speed

**Arrows** - give you unstoppable bulletsthat kills everything on its track

**Doge juice** - doubles your current ammo, and allows you to autofire

You get three lives, once you lose them all, game ends.
